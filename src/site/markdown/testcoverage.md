# Test Coverage #

## Test Procedure ##

With the testing framework JUnit5 it is really easy to test methods.
Created tests in src/java/at.fhj.iit for every implemented class.
This framework shows the amount of tests, the amount of passed tests and the test coverage.

| Test Class                      | Amount of Tests | Amount of passed Tests | Test Coverage (Methods) |
|:--------------------------------|:----------------|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| RootBeerTest                    |  27             | 27                     |  100%                   |
| BeerTest                        |  20             | 20                     |  100%                   |
| CoffeeTest                      |  25             | 25                     |  100%                   |
| ImportantSellInformationTest    |  5              |  5                     |  100%                   |
| LiquidTest                      |  7              |  7                     |  100%                   |
| RegistrierkasseTest             |  9              | 9                      |  100%                   |
| SimpleDrinkTest                 |  5              | 5                      |  100%                   |

## Explanation ##
Tests are done for common inputs but not every possible input is tested.
So we have 100% test coverage for all methods but only for the most common scenarios but not 100% test coverage for every possible scenario.
